# Homecoming-2019

We started out with a wireframe, and I let only Zander draw it out. This was a mistake since he missed how to set up the website. We finally got the wireframe set up and began coding.

I helped Jonah and Reese with the basics of coding. We also used w3schools for resources. We agreed on the colors and also found a way to make the text look nicer. We also learned how to move images in CSS. 

Finally, I taught the members of the group how to post on Github.
